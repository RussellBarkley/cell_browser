## Data availability

NucleusNet was [deposited](#huggingface-upload) to Hugging Face to facilitate data sharing and the repository was streamed to present images in interactive figures.
The full collection of 250,000 microscopy fields, 1,600 stitched images and corresponding mask files, as well as the cropped images were zipped and archived at Zenodo.
